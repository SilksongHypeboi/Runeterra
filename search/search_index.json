Maybe it wants something extremely specific, maybe it just wants you to explore in their name.</p> <p>Celestial- Remains mostly unchanged, there are many celestials on Targon Prime that can be your patron, based on the constellations in Runeterra's skies. Easiest way to get a contract with them is to climb Mount Targon. They might want to take their body for a joyride every once in a while or simply want you to live a certain way, but their motivations are almost always very self serving.</p> <p>Fiend- Becoming bound with a demon is incredibly rare, but possible.

At the heart of Wuju is spirit magic. The heart of the Wuju school is the people who wield this magic. Every martial stance, every poem, every meditation that Wuju practitioners have studied, they all exist for the sake of this magic. No armor can withstand attacks by master Wuju swordsmen. As long the user draws enough power from the Spirit Realm, they can sunder a mountain, a forest, or even the entire world. However, mortals are limited to the amount of power they can harness from the Spirit Realm due to their weaker physical forms. The only known living teacher of Wuju is Master Yi, after his homeland of Wuju was decimated, but he aims to spread the teachings of Wuju to as many students as possible.</p> <p>3rd level- Wuju Apprentice. When becoming a Wuju Fighter, one must learn focus and discipline. As an Apprentice, you gain the following:</p> <p>Meditation: You become able to use Second Wind twice between Short or Long Rests and, when you do so, you become resistant to nonmagical Bludgeoning, Slashing and Piercing damage until the start of your next turn.</p> <p>Soul Severing Slashes: As an action, you can channel the power of Wuju into your weapon, granting it the ability to slice the souls of your enemies. For the next minute, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 psychic damage. To keep the channel of energy into your weapon going, you must keep Concentration on this ability as you would with a spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p> <p>Wuju Mask. When choosing this subclass at third level, you are gifted or create your own Wuju Mask, with 7 eyes. While wearing this mask, you have Blindsight of 10ft and can see into the Spirit Realm to a range of 30ft.</p> <p>7th level- Alpha Strike. Your training in connecting with the Spirit Realm has paid off. As a bonus action, you can enter the Spirit Realm. Once you do this you disappear from the Material Plane until the end of your turn and thus cannot trigger attacks of opportunity from creatures not in the Spirit Realm. While in the spirit realm, you can still use the attack action against creatures in the Material Plane, counting as an unseen attacker to any that can\u2019t see into the Spirit Realm, and whenever you do and have access to multiple attacks from its use, you may move between hits. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom Modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p> <p>10th level- Discipline and Focus. At this level, your continued studies in any specific area of Wuju empowers you. Choose one of the following areas:</p> <p>Healing- You can now use your Second Wind on a creature other than yourself with a range of touch. When doing so, they also gain the damage resistance from Meditation until your next turn.</p> <p>Nature and magic- You gain a cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. Your spellcasting ability for it is Wisdom.</p> <p>Artifice- After each long rest, you can choose a nonmagical weapon or a set of nonmagical armor. By infusing it with Wuju, you change their appearance to have a more nature-like design, taking inspiration from long leaves or blades of grass, changing their color to be greener and making it either a +1 weapon or a +1 set of armor respectively, for the next 24hours.</p> <p>Physical build- When rolling damage with a finesse weapon, you can add both your Dexterity and your Strength modifier to the damage roll.</p> <p>15th level- Wuju Master. You are now a master of Wuju, and your connection to the Spirit of Wuju is stronger than before, changing a few key parts of Soul Severing Slashes:</p> <p>-Using it now only requires a bonus action.</p> <p>-The psychic damage is increased to a d8.</p> <p>-While concentrating on it, your movement does not trigger attacks of opportunity.</p> <p>Through the eyes of Wuju. Your Wuju Mask now gives you Truesight of 10ft instead of Blindsight. Additionally, while wearing it you gain advantage on Insight rolls for the purpose of trying to learn more about a creature.</p> <p>18th level- Manifesting the Spirit of Wuju. The spirit of Wuju lives within you empowering you in the following ways:</p> <p>-When using Alpha Strike, you can choose to automatically use Soul Severing Slashes as a part of it, still needing to expend a use of it.</p> <p>-While wearing your Wuju Mask, when using Second Wind, you can choose to summon an apparition of the Spirit of Wuju, instead of healing yourself. Every creature of your choice within 15ft of you must succeed a DC (10+ your proficiency bonus+ your wisdom modifier) Dexterity saving throw of take 1d10+your wisdom modifier psychic damage, taking half as much on a success, as the apparition quickly flies around the area and disappears again.</p>"},{"location":"Creatures/Dr%C3%BCvask/","title":"Dr\u00fcvask","text":"<p>A Freljordian version of the Giant Boar, also called a War-hog.

I will give full explanations to all the changes later on, and this list is more meant to be a quick reference for any instant doubts you might have as to how the world fundamentally differs.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Not all classes and subclasses will be available in this world, since there are tons of differences in the history of how things came to be. This also means certain classes and subclasses are more likely to have come from certain regions of the world, rather than others.</p> </li> <li> <p>All long lived playable races have their life expectancy changed to be similar to that of a Human. In Runeterra, the only long lived race by their sheer nature are the Yordles, and extensions to one's life are rare to come across.</p> </li> <li> <p>Most spellcasters in Runeterra are born with the potential for magic abilities, making it incredibly rare for one to attain magic without being born with it. This means that when playing classes that normally would have you discovering magic later in life, keep in mind that it is more likely your character was born with that innate talent and only developed it later in life. However, this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re locked out of classes that give you access to magic through other means, like Warlock deals or a Cleric\u2019s worship.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vastaya is the in-world term for most Races with animalistic features. They have a completely different history than the one that will be stated in the DnD source you use, but you can use their statistics and abilities as normal.</p> </li> <li> <p>==Certain changes will be done for the sake of gameplay and simplifying the connection between DnD and Runeterra, meaning that some aspects of the lore might be sacrificed.==</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Introduction%20Documents/Welcome%20to%20Runeterra/","title":"Welcome to Runeterra","text":"<p>Welcome to Runeterra!</p> <p>A land of magic, gods and remarkable wonders, filled with a complex network of narratives that is sure to entertain you and your adventuring party for a long, long time.</p> <p>This setting is meant for both players who enjoy League of Legends and its lore, and for those who never interacted with the game but are curious about the setting. At times, I will present you with information meant for those who have more knowledge of the lore of Runeterra, but I will be sure to ==highlight== all the points on which I do that.</p> <p>==First of all, this setting will be using the Interactive Map mentioned earlier, meaning I will not be including places like Camavor and Kathkan in any documentation, excluding possible mentions to it when discussing the Shadow Isles.==</p> <p>But most importantly, to avoid confusion later on, I will explain the biggest differences between this setting and places like the Forgotten Realms. In here, otherworldly powers originate from different sources, that for all intents and purposes will work in very similar ways, but have different names and history:</p> <p>The Feywild will be referred to as Bandle City;</p> <p>The Ethereal Plane is called the Spirit Realm;</p> <p>And the Shadowfell is called either the Death Realm or Mitna Rachnun (pronounced Rak-noon).</p> <p>However, all these realms are technically connected, simply considered to be incredibly distant from each other in their \u201cmirror of reality\u201d state.

Go forth, my champions!</p> <p>As for the fantasy I\u2019m trying to accomplish, I hope to give the parties that take on the adventures Runeterra has to offer a taste of what it is like to live in this world. I understand that many people will be interested in roleplaying as their favorite Champions, but my version of the setting will see the champions as individuals holding the highest possible amount of power, being heroes or legends (haha) talked about throughout the lands.

It was originally named The First Lands by the Vastayashai'rei, and many still call it by that name. It's also a nation with an ancient history, as it's the place of origin of the Vastayashai'rei, and the place where these beings once fought the Titans, before the birth of any organized society. In these mystical lands, the veil between the Mortal Realm and the Spirit Realm is thinner, allowing for a greater connection to magic through nature itself. It is common knowledge amongst the residents that living in community with nature is greatly beneficial not just to them and their families, but also to the generations that shall come and take their place in time. Thanks to this connection to nature and magic, in Ionia you won't see large buildings built with concrete or gigantic cities that grow larger and larger by cutting down trees and trampling over forests. Doing so could upset the nature spirits, so Ionians will usually call for the help of Woodweavers, individuals that can speak to the trees and ask them to grow in ways that will be useful for the people who wish to live there, making it so you will find many living houses, that shift over time, for it natural for a tree to keep growing. This doesn't make humanoid-made construction impossible, and you'll also find many many things that are built by humanoids, but at the core of it all is the connection to nature and respect for it.

An example of this is the fact that Ionia does not have an army. This doesn't mean the people can't fight. In fact, the lands of Ionia are dangerous, since their connection to the Spirit Realm has shaped the fauna and flora one may encounter and even given rise to the presence of spirits and demons. To be able to preserve their connection to the lands but also stay alive, many Ionians become deadly but graceful fighters, mages, dancers, and scholars by spending years and years training at one of the many schools and temples that exist throughout the islands, most of which are connected to one of the previously mentioned organizations.</p>"},{"location":"Places%20of%20note/Nations/Ionia/#however-it-all-changed","title":"However, it all changed","text":"<p>Not many years ago, Noxus invaded Ionia, because it caught wind of the way the inhabitants of Ionia live. They saw their devotion to peace as a weakness and took advantage of it, killing many in the process. As expected, even though their lands were being invaded, many Ionians refused to fight, firmly believing that was not the will of the lands and that this too shall pass. Others took up arms, shifting their views and even in so cases the goals of the organizations they leaded to be more extremist, so they could rally the people behind them and fight back the invaders. The invasion was still partly successful and Noxus took control of a small part of Ionia. As a result, no matter what reaction the people affected originally had, the invasion deeply scarred Ionia, both from the death of so many and from the shift of the mentality of those who remained. Now, years and years later, Ionia has become slightly more receptive to outsiders, as many have started journeying to the lands seeking enlightenment and adventurers started being hired to protect villages from all manner of threats. On the other hand, some are still uneasy with the presence of outsiders, believing anyone could be a Noxian spy, planning the next invasion.</p>"},{"location":"Places%20of%20note/Nations/Ionia/#zhyun","title":"Zhyun","text":"<p>One of Ionia's islands, and the one we will be focusing on at the start of the development of this setting.

What they are is hard to pin down, since they seem to mature at random times and live indefinitely, meaning you can be a Yordle that looks any age regardless of how old they are, sometimes being several centuries old. This doesn\u2019t mean you can control your appearance however, and whatever appearance you pick will generally be the one your character is \u201cstuck\u201d with for the foreseeable future. Also, their appearance is hard to nail down, mostly looking like vaguely humanoid bipedal mammals (though not all of them), some having features that resemble animals like squirrels and some having pretty humanoid faces. Their origin and appearance make them similar to Vastaya, but they are not Vastaya, and some members of that race even hate Yordles.</p> <p>That is because, since they are native to the Bandle City, like most of its inhabitants, Yordles tend to be jovial creatures and even pranksters completely unaware of the damage their pranks could realistically do or the dangers they get themselves into. They live uncaring benevolent lives because technically, Yordles can\u2019t die. If one were to be killed, their spirit would return to the Bandle Tree and eventually regenerate a new physical body for itself. Such a process takes an undetermined amount of time however (possibly centuries), meaning that having your Yordle character be killed while playing would still make you lose that character.</p> <p>Why would a Yordle become an adventurer? Simply put, Yordles love adventure, and there are Yordles all over Runeterra. One thing to note about that fact is that Yordles also tend to take on aspects of the places they travel too, influenced by their love of the daily lives of the beings they interact with. Just as easily as you can find a Yordle in Demacia sparring with soldiers to prepare for an upcoming war, you may find a completely pacifistic Yordle in Ionia in deep mediation or even (although rarely) an evil mastermind Yordle, influenced by the machinations or villains it came in contact with on their travels. That begs the question \u201cWhat do the people that interact with Yordles think of them? Do they question their origin or how long they live?\u201d And the answer is\u2026 No, not really. Thanks to their Glamour ability, mortals do not tend to think much of Yordles, quickly accepting their presence as a natural part of their daily lives.</p> <p>Ability Scores:\u00a0Choose one of: (a) Choose any +2; choose any other +1 (b) Choose three different +1</p> <p>Creature Type:\u00a0Fey</p> <p>Size:\u00a0Small</p> <p>Speed:\u00a030 feet</p> <p>Alignment: Any</p> <p>Fey.\u00a0Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid.</p> <p>Glamour.
