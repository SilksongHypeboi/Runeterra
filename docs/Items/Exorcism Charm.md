*consumable magic item*

Used to destroy Demons, especially [[Azakana]].
Carefully crafted by the Kinkou Order, it is meant to be used by its members, as the ritual for its usage is taught there. However, a character with connection can speak its command phrase and attempt to use it, needing to pass a DC15 Intelligence(Arcana) check to do so.

There are 3 tiers to this item, Lesser (Uncommon), Major (Rare) and Banishing (Very Rare). However, 4 Lesser charms can be used to mimic the effect of a Major charm, and 4 Major Charms, or 16 Lesser charms, can be used to mimic the effects of a Banishing charm.

To use these charms, one must use an action to speak their command phrase while holding it in their hand. Upon doing so, choose a fiend you can see within 30 feet of you. The effects change depending on the tier of the item.

#### Lesser Charm

If the fiend's Challenge Rating is equal or lower than 2, it must succeed a DC 10 Constitution Saving throw or be truly killed, vanishing from existence.
The saving throw increases to 12 if the creature has been lightly damaged, 15 if it is heavily damaged, and 18 if it is near death.
If the targeted creature has 0 hit points, it automatically fails the saving throw.

#### Major Charm

If the fiend's Challenge Rating is equal or lower than 5, it must succeed a DC 10 Constitution Saving throw or be truly killed, vanishing from existence.
The saving throw increases to 12 if the creature has been lightly damaged, 15 if it is heavily damaged, and 18 if it is near death.
If the targeted creature has 0 hit points, it automatically fails the saving throw.

#### Banishing Charm

If the fiend's Challenge Rating is equal or lower than 15, it must succeed a DC 10 Constitution Saving throw or be truly killed, vanishing from existence.
The saving throw increases to 12 if the creature has been lightly damaged, 15 if it is heavily damaged, and 18 if it is near death.
If the targeted creature has 0 hit points, it automatically fails the saving throw.
