The Kinkou order is an ancient Ionian order that focuses on keeping the balance between the physical world and the Spirit Realm. In doing so, they must show no preference for either.
This manifests in them being the mediators between the two sides. If a mortal were to interfere in spiritual matters, they'd have to be stopped, by word or by force if necessary, and if a spiritual being disturbed the lives of mortals, they'd have to stop them too.
It also means they, for the most part, completely disregard matters between mortals, like violence and even murder, and they did not join the Ionian people in defending the land against the Noxian Invaders, for they believe that is not their responsibility.

To be a member or the Kinkou Order is to go through a long and arduous training regiment, learning unwavering discipline, martial arts, and spiritual arts. To them, their devotion to spiritual matters functions as their religion, mostly connected to the [[Cleric Deities|God Willow]].

#### The Leaders of the Kinkou

There are 3 leading positions within the Kinkou order, each representing a different philosophy of the Kinkou, namely:

**The Fist of Shadow**- Has the sacred duty of Pruning the Tree, done through eliminating those who threaten the balance of Ionia, and raising the next generation of assassins. This position usually deals more with mortals than spirits, and used to be held by Akali until she left the order to become a rogue assassin, meaning the position is now vacant.

**The Heart of the Storm**- As opposed to the Fist of Shadow, this position's sacred duty of Coursing the Sun is all about conveying the justice of the Kinkou, being mostly tasked with fighting significant spiritual threats. There has only ever been one Heart of the Storm, Kennen, an ageless [[Yordle]] who has been protecting these lands for centuries.

**The Eye of Twilight**- Currently held by Shen, who has been rebuilding the Kinkou since the death of his father, in this position lies the Master of the Kinkou, he who must stand above all others. That is what their sacred duty, Watching the Stars, truly means, to exercise judgment untainted by prejudice. The Master of the Kinkou must make hard decisions to make sure the Order stays true to its mission, and to maintain balance within the entirety of the [[Ionia|First Lands]].


## The Present

All three sects of the Kinkou got spread thin through Ionia in recent times, since the influx of people on the islands has brought about even more imbalance.
This means they've focused their efforts in training [[Kinkou Initiate|more members of the Kinkou]], but it also means they have, from time to time, used the help of the adventurers arriving on the islands to fulfil their duties, specially when it comes to dealing with the [[Azakana]].
