Ionia is a nation of magic, nature, harmony and beauty. It was originally named The First Lands by the Vastayashai'rei, and many still call it by that name. It's also a nation with an ancient history, as it's the place of origin of the Vastayashai'rei, and the place where these beings once fought the Titans, before the birth of any organized society.
In these mystical lands, the veil between the Mortal Realm and the [[Spirit Realm]] is thinner, allowing for a greater connection to magic through nature itself. It is common knowledge amongst the residents that living in community with nature is greatly beneficial not just to them and their families, but also to the generations that shall come and take their place in time.
Thanks to this connection to nature and magic, in Ionia you won't see large buildings built with concrete or gigantic cities that grow larger and larger by cutting down trees and trampling over forests. Doing so could upset the nature spirits, so Ionians will usually call for the help of Woodweavers, individuals that can speak to the trees and ask them to grow in ways that will be useful for the people who wish to live there, making it so you will find many living houses, that shift over time, for it natural for a tree to keep growing. This doesn't make humanoid-made construction impossible, and you'll also find many many things that are built by humanoids, but at the core of it all is the connection to nature and respect for it.

Ionia is made up of many islands, none of which have a central government, having the "organized civilization" be mostly made up of small villages spread around, most of which have their own council, sometimes surveyed by some regional administration. These administrations do not necessarily hold the same values as one another, and can even be possibly allied with one of the also many organizations that exist around Ionia:

-[[Hirana Order]]

-[[Kinkou Order]]

-[[Navori Brotherhood]]

-[[Shadow Order]]

-[[Shojin Order]]

-[[Wuju Order]]

The oceans around the entirety of Ionia are unruly and extremely difficult to navigate, meaning all who wish to reach The First Lands incur some risk even if they pay a skilled captain, specially if the lands themselves to not want them there.

## A Land of Peace

Many different philosophies evolved in Ionia over the millennia of its existence, but most center around a common theme: peace. An example of this is the fact that Ionia does not have an army.
This doesn't mean the people can't fight. In fact, the lands of Ionia are dangerous, since their connection to the Spirit Realm has shaped the fauna and flora one may encounter and even given rise to the presence of spirits and demons.
To be able to preserve their connection to the lands but also stay alive, many Ionians become deadly but graceful fighters, mages, dancers, and scholars by spending years and years training at one of the many schools and temples that exist throughout the islands, most of which are connected to one of the previously mentioned organizations.

#### However, it all changed
Not many years ago, Noxus invaded Ionia, because it caught wind of the way the inhabitants of Ionia live. They saw their devotion to peace as a weakness and took advantage of it, killing many in the process.
As expected, even though their lands were being invaded, many Ionians refused to fight, firmly believing that was not the will of the lands and that this too shall pass. Others took up arms, shifting their views and even in so cases the goals of the organizations they leaded to be more extremist, so they could rally the people behind them and fight back the invaders.
The invasion was still partly successful and Noxus took control of a small part of Ionia. As a result, no matter what reaction the people affected originally had, the invasion deeply scarred Ionia, both from the death of so many and from the shift of the mentality of those who remained.
Now, years and years later, Ionia has become slightly more receptive to outsiders, as many have started journeying to the lands seeking enlightenment and adventurers started being hired to protect villages from all manner of threats. On the other hand, some are still uneasy with the presence of outsiders, believing anyone could be a Noxian spy, planning the next invasion.


# Zhyun

![[my map of zhyun 1.png]]

One of Ionia's islands, and the one we will be focusing on at the start of the development of this setting.
Some things to note about this island: 
-It a very mountainous island, having vast highlands, covered in forest.
-It is home to a very peculiar rock formation, known as the Swirl Rocks.
-The Kashuri Armory is situated somewhere on the island.
-It has its own council, one that is respected by most villages.


## Kawazoe

Besides the Noxian ports, there is one route known to some adventurers that can get you in the continent safely, which is one that takes you to Kawazoe, a fishing village built right where the River Meigetsu meets the sea. It is a village known having become more and more open to outsiders over the years, and a great starting spot for many adventurers.

## Zhyunia

Largely considered the largest town in all of Zhyun, its the place where the Zhyun council resided before the Noxian invasion.

## Kashuri

The Kashuri Armory used to be a place that forged traditional weapons. The Noxian invasion changed that. Nowadays, they moved to combining magic and technology, like they do with Hextech in Piltover and Zaun.


Potential threats in this area:
The wildlife, both nonmagical beasts and some magical ones
