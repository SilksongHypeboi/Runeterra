The Wuju style is a martial art from [[Ionia]] that draws its power from the [[Spirit Realm]] the same way the [[Vastaya|Vastayashai'rei]] change their shapes and manipulate the elements.
At the heart of Wuju is spirit magic. The heart of the Wuju school is the people who wield this magic. Every martial stance, every poem, every meditation that Wuju practitioners have studied, they all exist for the sake of this magic.
No armor can withstand attacks by master Wuju swordsmen. As long the user draws enough power from the Spirit Realm, they can sunder a mountain, a forest, or even the entire world. However, mortals are limited to the amount of power they can harness from the Spirit Realm due to their weaker physical forms.
The only known living teacher of Wuju is Master Yi, after his homeland of Wuju was decimated, but he aims to spread the teachings of Wuju to as many students as possible.

**3rd level-** **Wuju Apprentice.** When becoming a Wuju Fighter, one must learn focus and discipline. As an Apprentice, you gain the following:

_Meditation_: You become able to use Second Wind twice between Short or Long Rests and, when you do so, you become resistant to nonmagical Bludgeoning, Slashing and Piercing damage until the start of your next turn.

_Soul Severing Slashes:_ As an action, you can channel the power of Wuju into your weapon, granting it the ability to slice the souls of your enemies. For the next minute, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 psychic damage. To keep the channel of energy into your weapon going, you must keep Concentration on this ability as you would with a spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

**Wuju Mask.** When choosing this subclass at third level, you are gifted or create your own Wuju Mask, with 7 eyes. While wearing this mask, you have Blindsight of 10ft and can see into the Spirit Realm to a range of 30ft.

**7th level-** **Alpha Strike.** Your training in connecting with the Spirit Realm has paid off. As a bonus action, you can enter the Spirit Realm. Once you do this you disappear from the Material Plane until the end of your turn and thus cannot trigger attacks of opportunity from creatures not in the Spirit Realm. While in the spirit realm, you can still use the attack action against creatures in the Material Plane, counting as an unseen attacker to any that can’t see into the Spirit Realm, and whenever you do and have access to multiple attacks from its use, you may move between hits. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom Modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


**10th level-** **Discipline and Focus.** At this level, your continued studies in any specific area of Wuju empowers you. Choose one of the following areas:

_Healing-_ You can now use your Second Wind on a creature other than yourself with a range of touch. When doing so, they also gain the damage resistance from Meditation until your next turn.

_Nature and magic-_ You gain a cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. Your spellcasting ability for it is Wisdom.

_Artifice-_ After each long rest, you can choose a nonmagical weapon or a set of nonmagical armor. By infusing it with Wuju, you change their appearance to have a more nature-like design, taking inspiration from long leaves or blades of grass, changing their color to be greener and making it either a +1 weapon or a +1 set of armor respectively, for the next 24hours.

_Physical build-_ When rolling damage with a finesse weapon, you can add both your Dexterity and your Strength modifier to the damage roll.

**15th level-** **Wuju Master.** You are now a master of Wuju, and your connection to the Spirit of Wuju is stronger than before, changing a few key parts of Soul Severing Slashes:

-Using it now only requires a bonus action.

-The psychic damage is increased to a d8.

-While concentrating on it, your movement does not trigger attacks of opportunity.

**Through the eyes of Wuju.** Your Wuju Mask now gives you Truesight of 10ft instead of Blindsight. Additionally, while wearing it you gain advantage on Insight rolls for the purpose of trying to learn more about a creature.

**18th level-** **Manifesting the Spirit of Wuju.** The spirit of Wuju lives within you empowering you in the following ways:

-When using Alpha Strike, you can choose to automatically use Soul Severing Slashes as a part of it, still needing to expend a use of it.

-While wearing your Wuju Mask, when using Second Wind, you can choose to summon an apparition of the Spirit of Wuju, instead of healing yourself. Every creature of your choice within 15ft of you must succeed a DC (10+ your proficiency bonus+ your wisdom modifier) Dexterity saving throw of take 1d10+your wisdom modifier psychic damage, taking half as much on a success, as the apparition quickly flies around the area and disappears again.
