You can still make deals with powerful entities to gain some of their power. Here are you options for patrons.

**Archfey-** There are certain powerful [[Bandle City]] spirits that can be your patron. Just like the usual Archfey Patron from the Player's Handbook, these spirits' motivations to make a pact with you are often hard to understand. Maybe it wants something extremely specific, maybe it just wants you to explore in their name.

**Celestial-** Remains mostly unchanged, there are many celestials on [[Targon Prime]] that can be your patron, based on the constellations in Runeterra's skies. Easiest way to get a contract with them is to climb Mount [[Targon]]. They might want to take their body for a joyride every once in a while or simply want you to live a certain way, but their motivations are almost always very self serving.

**Fiend-** Becoming bound with a demon is incredibly rare, but possible. The demon you're bound with will become a part of you as a part of the deal.

**Fathomless-** The Buhru Priests of the Serpent Isles get access to this one. The God of Motion, Nagakabouros blesses them with its gifts, and demands they go out into the world and test the spirits of those they find worthy.

**Hexblade-** You somehow got the approval of Mordekaiser, he who controls [[Mitna Rachnun]]. What he wants is powerful warriors. Ones he can claim once they die and join him in Mitna Rachnun.

**Undead-** The Ruined King of the [[Shadow Isles]] empowers you, he wants you to spread the corruption of the Black Mist. Whether or not you listen to him will not break your pact however, as once the power of the Black Mist is obtained, it is not so easily discarded. Your form of Dread Surrounds you in the Black Mist. The more powerful you become, the more Wraith-like it makes you.
