These nations exist somewhere outside of the borders of the map. Not much is known about them and not many know of their existence. As such, they are not available in this version of the [[Runeterra]] setting.

Sill, there are a few things of note about them.

- Camavor and Kathkan are neighboring nations in some other continent.

- Camavor is hailed as the original birthplace of the Dragons and all their descendants. It is also the long forgotten kingdom that used to be ruled by Viego, [[Warlocks|The Ruined King]].
- Not much is known of Kathkan, besides the fact that it is where the Primal Demon of Joy, Ashlesh, used to be imprisoned.
