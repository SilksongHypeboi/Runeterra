(For character creation purposes, the only change to apply to races that fall under the Vastaya umbrella is that they all know [[Available Languages|Vastayan]] as their starting language.)

The Vastaya are a race of creatures that draw power from the Spirit Realm. They have many subraces, and some of them have a higher connection to the magic of the Spirit Realm than others, explaining why some of them will be considered humanoids and some fey.

They are descendants of the Vastayashai’rei, deathless shapechangers who could wield the natural world itself as a weapon.

This means the incredibly rare Changeling race is actually also a Vastayan race, one that is considered to have a higher connection to the powers of their ancestors. The Oovi-kat were a tribe of Changelings that mysteriously disappeared, **and it is also the tribe Neeko was a part of.**

In recent years, the Vastaya are usually divided into different types, depending on the location in which they adapted into the forms they hold today and what their animal spirit is. These types are measured with two separate scales:

-Tribes based on their environment, which are pretty self-explanatory:

·         Tribe of Land

·         Tribe of Sea

·         Tribe of Air

-Designations based on how humanoid they are:

·         Animal-like- Vastaya that resemble other animals but are bipedal or otherwise mildly humanoid.

·         Human-like- Vastaya that closely resemble humans, especially in terms of facial features, but still retain a modest level of animalistic elements: for instance, feline or foxlike ears, tails, or feathers.

·         Shapeshifters- Vastaya that can retain either a human or animal appearance of their choosing, but they are able to shapeshift in and out of each form.

All these definitions can be used to re-flavor any race you want that could be considered a Vastaya.

Since Vastaya have a connection to the Spirit Realm, they’re more likely to take up magic than others and many even end up leaning fully into their shape changing abilities, becoming some of the very few Druids out there that are not Shamans.
