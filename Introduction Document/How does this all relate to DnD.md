How does this all relate to DnD?

Here is a shortened list of changes applied to the basic rules of DnD when playing in this setting. I will give full explanations to all the changes later on, and this list is more meant to be a quick reference for any instant doubts you might have as to how the world fundamentally differs.

- Not all classes and subclasses will be available in this world, since there are tons of differences in the history of how things came to be. This also means certain classes and subclasses are more likely to have come from certain regions of the world, rather than others.

- All long lived playable races have their life expectancy changed to be similar to that of a Human. In [[Runeterra]], the only long lived race by their sheer nature are the [[Yordle|Yordles]], and extensions to one's life are rare to come across.

- Most spellcasters in Runeterra are born with the potential for magic abilities, making it incredibly rare for one to attain magic without being born with it. This means that when playing classes that normally would have you discovering magic later in life, keep in mind that it is more likely your character was born with that innate talent and only developed it later in life. However, this doesn’t mean you’re locked out of classes that give you access to magic through other means, like [[Warlocks|Warlock]] deals or a [[Cleric Deities|Cleric]]’s worship.

- [[Vastaya]] is the in-world term for most Races with animalistic features. The have a completely different history than the one that will be stated in the DnD source you use, but you can use their statistics and abilities as normal.

- ==Certain changes will be done for the sake of gameplay and simplifying the connection between DnD and Runeterra, meaning that some aspects of the lore might be sacrificed.==
