The nation of [[Demacia]] was founded in the Petricite Forest during the Rune Wars, as a way to escape it.
That is because Petricite is known to absorb magic, rendering it useless.

Over the years, not only did Petricite become a very popular building material in Demacia, it was also adapted into several other forms:

## Petricite Weapons
Weapons imbued with Petricite are rare, because it is hard to work with Petricite and harder even to combine it with other materials to make a proper weapon. Still, despite their rarity, they're highly sought after for their ability to cut through magic, and can sometimes even be found outside of Demacia.
## Petricite Poison

## Petricite Golems
The [[Petricite Golem|Petricite Golems]] are magical constructs made with Petricite. Most were built by the Durand House of Demacia. They are known to weaken or even nullify magic and have been used to fight mages and to aid the Demacian Army.
