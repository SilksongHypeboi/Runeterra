No matter how you play it, [[Ionia]] is a magic land. Unlike the Forgotten Realms, where a lot of the imagery centers around medieval times with a focus on low amounts of magic, with it being even considered rare in some cases, Ionia's imagery centers on both nature and magic.
Picture beautiful lush forests, ancient forgotten shrines, trickster spirits and a lot of wildlife that seems to have been imbued with the magic that radiates from everywhere. The origin of that magic is the Spirit Realm, and there's a big culture around it.

Most magic users one can find here are either Woodweavers, those capable of speaking with plants and magically influence them (often to make living spaces and the like), members of a specific organization, who focus on their own type of magic, or the occasional adventurer.

Asian countries, and especially Japan, were the base inspiration for a lot of what you'll find here, so you can rely on that when naming places, people and artifacts, and even for how things must look.
