In Runeterra, there aren’t nearly as many deities one can worship for power as in the Forgotten Realms, and the one you choose to be empowering you can matter a great deal about where you are from. Here’s a list of the Cleric Domains and their associated [[Runeterra|Runeterran]] Deities.

Arcana- Bard, The Bard

Death- Mordekaiser, The Iron Revenant

Forge- Ornn, The Great Ram

Grave- Lamb and Wolf, The Kindred (though they might be worshipped under a different name, depending on the region)

Knowledge- Bard, The Bard

Life- Soraka, The Starchild

Light- Leona, The Golden Sister

Nature- The God Willow (Now the position is actually shared by Ivern, the Green Father, but most don't know that)

Order- Kayle, The Judicator

Peace- Taric, The Protector

Tempest- Valhir, The Volibear

Trickery- Zoe, The Trickster

Twilight- Diana, The Silver Sister

War- Pantheon, The Warrior

Some of these deities have specific cults and are worshipped in specific areas or the world, most being in Targon, where people from around the world go to be closer to these Celestials, and Shurima, the neighboring land. There have been examples of those who use their power without being from the associated region, but those are less common.

[[Targon]] and [[Shurima]]- Bard, Soraka, Leona, Kayle, Taric, Zoe, Diana, Pantheon.

[[Noxus]]- Mordekaiser.

[[Freljord]]- Ornn, Valhir.

[[Ionia]]- The Godwillow.

[[Demacia]]- Kayle.

The only deity not present in any of these lists is the Lamb and Wolf who, as mentioned before, are worshipped everywhere, sometimes under different names and appearances.

Although these are the only deities available to worship as a cleric (for the sake of simplicity), there are many other religions are cults across Runeterra, although those can't usually draw power from the focus of their worship, only empower them.
