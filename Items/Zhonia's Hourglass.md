**Rare**

**Consumable**

A tiny golden hourglass, containing a tiny portion of the Sands of Time inside. If used as a normal hourglass, the time for the all the sand to go from one side of it to the other is 5 minutes. While holding it, you have access to the Time Stop reaction.

**Time Stop.** When an attack roll is about to be rolled against you or youâ€™re forced to do a Saving Throw, you can instead crush the hourglass in your hand. If you do so, you are unaffected by whatever was targeting you as your time is frozen. To everyone else, you seem to disappear instantly, but even though you are not in the Spirit Realm or in any pocket dimension, you are still in the same spot, frozen in time and unable to move. You reappear in the same spot at the start of your next turn.

Once you crush the Hourglass, it will reappear somewhere on your person after 1d4 days.
