The Primal Demons. Not much is known about them, and I do not have a stat block prepared, but picture something with a power level that can match the gods.
Like other demons, they feed on specific emotions, having full control over a specific domain, making them stand above any other demon in that department.

The known ones are:

Fiddlesticks, Lord of Fear;

Ashlesh, Lord of Joy.

It is possible to encounter an avatar of Fiddlesticks, but currently not Ashlesh, as he has somehow been imprisoned and is currently being used as a weapon by Nilah.
