Yordles are spirits that appear in pockets of the Spirit Realm, and are native to the mystical place known as Bandle City. What they are is hard to pin down, since they seem to mature at random times and live indefinitely, meaning you can be a Yordle that looks any age regardless of how old they are, sometimes being several centuries old. This doesn’t mean you can control your appearance however, and whatever appearance you pick will generally be the one your character is “stuck” with for the foreseeable future. Also, their appearance is hard to nail down, mostly looking like vaguely humanoid bipedal mammals (though not all of them), some having features that resemble animals like squirrels and some having pretty humanoid faces. Their origin and appearance make them similar to Vastaya, but they are not Vastaya, and some members of that race even hate Yordles.

That is because, since they are native to the Bandle City, like most of its inhabitants, Yordles tend to be jovial creatures and even pranksters completely unaware of the damage their pranks could realistically do or the dangers they get themselves into. They live uncaring benevolent lives because technically, Yordles can’t die. If one were to be killed, their spirit would return to the Bandle Tree and eventually regenerate a new physical body for itself. Such a process takes an undetermined amount of time however (possibly centuries), meaning that having your Yordle character be killed while playing would still make you lose that character.

Why would a Yordle become an adventurer? Simply put, Yordles love adventure, and there are Yordles all over Runeterra. One thing to note about that fact is that Yordles also tend to take on aspects of the places they travel too, influenced by their love of the daily lives of the beings they interact with. Just as easily as you can find a Yordle in Demacia sparring with soldiers to prepare for an upcoming war, you may find a completely pacifistic Yordle in Ionia in deep mediation or even (although rarely) an evil mastermind Yordle, influenced by the machinations or villains it came in contact with on their travels. That begs the question “What do the people that interact with Yordles think of them? Do they question their origin or how long they live?” And the answer is… No, not really. Thanks to their Glamour ability, mortals do not tend to think much of Yordles, quickly accepting their presence as a natural part of their daily lives.
