Welcome to Runeterra!

A land of magic, gods and remarkable wonders, filled with a complex network of narratives that is sure to entertain you and your adventuring party for a long, long time.

This setting is meant for both players who enjoy League of Legends and its lore, and for those who never interacted with the game but are curious about the setting. At times, I will present you with information meant for those who have more knowledge of the lore of Runeterra, but I will be sure to ==highlight== all the points on which I do that.

==First of all, this setting will be using the Interactive Map mentioned earlier, meaning I will not be including places like Camavor and Kathkan in any documentation, excluding possible mentions to it when discussing the Shadow Isles.==

But most importantly, to avoid confusion later on, I will explain the biggest differences between this setting and places like the Forgotten Realms. In here, otherworldly powers originate from different sources, that for all intents and purposes will work in very similar ways, but have different names and history:

The Feywild will be referred to as [[Bandle City]];

The Ethereal Plane is called the [[Spirit Realm]];

And the Shadowfell is called either the Death Realm or [[Mitna Rachnun]] _(pronounced Rak-noon)._

However, all these realms are technically connected, simply considered to be incredibly distant from each other in their “mirror of reality” state. The Material Plane can be referred to as exactly that or the Material Realm.

Although I want to cover as much of the land as possible, there are obviously gaps in my knowledge and things I will get wrong, so I highly recommend that any Dungeon Master planning to use this setting visit the articles in the League of Legends wiki themselves to learn more, having my full blessing to change anything I’ve written here in their own version of Runeterra because I either got it wrong or because you disagree with my ruling. Go forth, my champions!

As for the fantasy I’m trying to accomplish, I hope to give the parties that take on the adventures Runeterra has to offer a taste of what it is like to live in this world. I understand that many people will be interested in roleplaying as their favorite Champions, but my version of the setting will see the champions as individuals holding the highest possible amount of power, being heroes or legends _(haha)_ talked about throughout the lands. As such, unless you are playing at a pretty high level, I would advise having the Champions as NPCs the players can encounter rather than Playable Characters.
