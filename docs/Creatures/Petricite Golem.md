It is possible for a player to be a Warforged that is also a Petricite Golem. A good way to represent this is to give them the ability to dispel any magic effect on them over a long rest, though I suggest trading something away for it. At later levels, a Petricite Golem could become powerful enough to gain the ability Magic Resistance.

Petricite Golems are Golems made of Petricite. Most of them were built by the descendants of House Durand of [[Demacia]].
