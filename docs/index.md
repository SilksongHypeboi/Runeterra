# Welcome to Runeterra Settings TTRPG

Adventuring in Runeterra, a DnD setting designed by Silk

This document is a fan-made concept made by me, Silk. In it, I will be taking you to the wonderful setting of Runeterra, the world in which games like League of Legends, Legends of Runeterra and the soon to be released 2XKO take place, along with beloved shows like Arcane. It is made to be played in the Tabletop Roleplaying Game system of _Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition_. It was made for personal, non-commercial purposes.
