**Languages in [[Runeterra]]**

Rather than being so closely tied with your Race, the languages you might know will, in most cases, be related to your place of origin.
The history of this world has made it so many languages have been shaped into existence, making it so most large nations have their own. Here’s a simple list of the languages accessible to characters while playing in this setting:

**Standard Languages**

**Common**- Thanks to the Continental Language Treaty, signed in [[Piltover And Zaun|Piltover]] a few centuries ago, most of Valoran, the central continent, speaks a unified language and that language got so widespread through trading routes and adventurers that even other lands started speaking it, with many regional differences and accents popping up.

**Demacian**- The main language spoken in [[Demacia]] and in many of the surrounding nations.

**Freljordian**- The main language spoken in the [[Freljord]], with many tiny variations between all the tribes.

**Ionian**- The main language spoken in [[Ionia]], often referred to as Zhyun by Ionians, as it’s only one of many dialects around the lands, though it is the most popular one.

**Ixtali**- The main language spoken in [[Ixtal]], spoken by most of its non-Vastayan inhabitants.

**Shuriman**- The modern version of the Ancient Shuriman language, spoken by all those how live in [[Shurima|the desert]].

**Targonian**- The main language spoken in [[Targon]], with a written script based on the shapes of the constellations in the sky.

**Vastayan**- The language spoken by most [[Vastaya]], independently of where they’re from.

**Yordle**- The language spoken by [[Yordle|Yordles]] and other creatures of Bandle City.

**Va-Nox**- The main language spoken in [[Noxus]], taught in all regions of the empire.

  

**Exotic Languages**

These languages will usually be the ones used for the verbal components of spells, as they hold ancient power.

**Buhru**- The language spoken by the inhabitants of the Serpent Isles.

**Draconic**- The language spoken by dragons and their kin.

**Helian**- The language that used to be spoken in the Blessed Isles. Can still be encountered in the [[Shadow Isles]].

**Ochnun**- The Language of the Dead, spoken in [[Mitna Rachnun]].

**Ur-Demacian, Ur-Freljordian, Ur-Ionian, Ur-Ixtali, Ur-Shuriman** and **Ur-Nox**- Ancient forms of the languages now spoken by the different nations. Two other languages also come from these: Vastayan from Ur-Ionian and Targonian from Ur-Shuriman.
