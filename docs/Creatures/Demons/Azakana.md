Azakana are a subsector of [[Lesser demons|Lesser Demon]] that can be encountered specifically in Ionia.
Just like other lesser demons, they are not very powerful and the negative emotion the must feed on is always very, very specific, as shown in the image bellow. Not only that, but Azakana tend to feed off of the emotions of only 1 host at a time, hoping to slowly weaken them over time, until the host eventually dies. Once they've absorbed enough emotions through killing both people and spirits, they become Full Demons, also known as Akana. Their fighting capabilities as an Azakana are small, but these demons become exponentially more dangerous as they become Akana.

Although their physical forms can be weakened to the point that they become practically harmless, Azakana cannot be destroyed or banished without the use of a Spirit Weapon or [[Petricite]].
